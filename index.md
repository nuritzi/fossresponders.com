## Need help?

If you work on open source and are affected by Coronavirus, please get in touch. We are actively looking for ways to help community members.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/foss-responders/support-requests/issues/new), [join our Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com/#crisis-working-group) or email [foss-responders@googlegroups.com](mailto:foss-responders@googlegroups.com).

## Conferences

- Here is [a dynamic list of cancelled events](https://airtable.com/shrETNURgXNrGWbd8/tblc49hMMykARebo8). Know of another event that's affected? [Add it here](https://airtable.com/shr5QBJUPPOQUJfND).
- If you were sponsoring a cancelled conference for recruitment purposes and you still want to connect with prospective candidates, Indeed is working on scheduling virtual hiring events. [Click here for more information](https://events.indeed.com/hiringevents/#get_started_form).

What else should be here? [Get in touch](mailto:foss-responders@googlegroups.com!)


## Funding

- [Indeed](https://indeed.com) has started a fund with $10k to focus on projects impacted by COVID-19. They're looking for others to join in and help with organization, sponsorship, mentorship, and outreach.

## About

<p class="center"><a href="https://slack.opencollective.com/#crisis-working-group"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-open%20collective-blue" alt="Slack link to Open Collective Slack"/></a></p>

Open source software depends upon real-world interactions just as much as it does on code. With the alarming spread of the Coronavirus, the open source ecosystem is being enormously impacted. This site is one of many efforts to help.

This initiative started as an organic movement led by Duane O'Brien (Indeed.com), Megan Byrd-Sanicki (Google), and others. We welcome others who would like to help out!

## Sponsors and Backers

FOSS Responders is an open source, open project. Anyone can jump in and work on it. It is entirely volunteer-run. Right now, we're in particular need of funders, designers, and people to spread the word.

Some of the companies where our volunteers work (but may or may not be representing their company) include:

- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
- [Google](https://google.com)
- [Indeed](https://protocol.ai)
- [Maintainer Mountaineer](https://maintainer.io)
- [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)
- [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/)
- [Storj](https://storj.io)
- ...and yours?

## Other Efforts

While not dedicated entirely to open source, here are some other relevant programs:

* [Covid19 Response Fund](https://covid19responsefund.org/). Donate directly to the WHO, who will allocate funds to efforts that need it.
* [Portland Corona Virus Mutual Aid Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/portland-corona-virus-mutual-aid-fund). Donate to those in Portland who need help.
